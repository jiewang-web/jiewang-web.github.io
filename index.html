I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) in the Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering (ESE) Department. 
I am a member of the <a href="https://span.engineering.wustl.edu/index.html">Sensing and Processing Across Networks (SPAN) Lab</a> led by <a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Neal-Patwari.html">Professor Neal Patwari</a>. 
Prior to WashU, I received B.S. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering and B.A. in English at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

<br><br>

My research interests include dynamic spectrum sharing, wireless sensor networking, and RF sensing. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in our research!
