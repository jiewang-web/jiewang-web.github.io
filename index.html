  I am a Ph.D. candidate at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) in the Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering (ESE) Department. 
I am a member of the <a href="https://patwarilab.com/index.html">Sensing and Processing Across Networks (SPAN) Lab</a> led by <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/patwari-neal/">Professor Neal Patwari</a>. 
Prior to WashU, I received a B.S. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering and a B.A. degree in English from Sichuan University in 2019.
